🌊 Fragrance Flow

Fragrance Flow is a specialized inventory management system designed for fragrance collectors. The project was born from a passion for scent collecting and a desire to bridge the gap between a physical hobby and modern software development.

🚀 Key Features
• User Authentication: Secure login system with permission-based logic (Admin/User).

• Inventory Management: Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for managing a fragrance collection.

• Smart Suggestions: A unique feature that suggests fragrances based on the user's local weather(!Work in progress).

• Tech Stack: Uses ip-api.com for geolocation and a weather API to determine the best scent for the current conditions (!Work in progress).

• Security First: Implementation of secure coding practices to protect user data and credentials.

🛠️ Technical Deep Dive
 Security & Environment Management
• To ensure professional-level security, I implemented Environment Variables for handling sensitive data like SQL connection strings and API keys. This prevents accidental credential leaks when pushing code to public repositories.

Database Integration
• The system utilizes MS SQL Server for robust data persistence. I've focused on learning deep SQL integration with C#, ensuring data integrity and efficient querying.

Modern C# Architecture
• The project is built with a focus on clean code and modularity:

WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation): For a rich desktop user experience (Upcoming).

Asynchronous Programming: Utilizing async/await for non-blocking API calls and database operations.

📈 Learning Journey
• This project represents a significant deep dive into full-stack development. Within the first 14 hours of development, I have successfully implemented:

A functioning SQL-backed authentication system.

API chaining (Geolocation -> Weather data).

Dynamic suggestion logic.

📍 Futere Plans
 • I plan to continue this project with new features and refactoring.

 • As you might see this is yet to be a fullstack application i plan on implementing either wpf or web based gui later on.

 • Start from fresh and do more oop and DI.
