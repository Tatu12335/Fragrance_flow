With this project i wanted to do something new, so i started thinking about my hobbies and what type of project could i make
based on them, first i started thinking about the gym, but i just didnt figure out how to bring my vision to life yet.
But then i started thinking about my fragrance collecting hobby, and i got the project idea, i will make a fragrance 
inventory system.

I think i will need to learn so much new stuff for this project, i already have a little bit of experience in wpf
and sql but not enought, so atleast i need to fully learn those. I will also try to make this as safe as possible,
so that when i make this repo public my sql passwords wont be stolen.

I decided for now its best to use enviroment variables, maybe i will host this project on some other server and 
then i can set up the variable on that server too.
